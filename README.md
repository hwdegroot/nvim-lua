## Setup

Clone this repo to `~/.config/nvim` and profit. Requires nvim > 0.8.

## Acknowledgments

I stole most of the configuration from other people. I do not know exactly from whom, but
I started [from init.vim tp init.lua - a crash course](https://www.notonlycode.org/neovim-lua-config/)
and then used configuration from definetaly from [ecosse3](https://github.com/ecosse3/nvim), so definetaly
check out his repo's.
